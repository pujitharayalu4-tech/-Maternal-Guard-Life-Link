# Maternal-Guard & Life-Link

An AI-powered web application designed to support rural maternal healthcare by
predicting pregnancy risk levels and enabling emergency blood donor matching.

## Problem Statement
In rural areas, delayed diagnosis and lack of donor availability during postpartum
hemorrhage often leads to preventable maternal deaths. This project provides
data-driven risk prediction and a digital donor network.

## Features
- Maternal risk prediction using Machine Learning
- Feature importance for explainability
- Emergency SOS trigger for high-risk cases
- Blood donor registration and matching
- Web-based interface using Streamlit

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
Maternal Health Risk Dataset (Kaggle)

## Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Feature Importance

## Team
- Team size: 4 members
